# SAFE – Terms of Use & Rules

## 1. Usage Rules

SAFE is a security-focused tool designed to provide end-to-end encryption and safe file handling. By using SAFE, you agree to comply with the following rules:

* Do **not** use SAFE to store, transmit, or share illegal, harmful, or unauthorized content, including but not limited to malware, pirated material, or content that violates applicable laws.
* Keep your passwords, encryption keys, and sensitive credentials strictly private; never share them with anyone under any circumstances.
* SAFE does **not** store plaintext files or encryption keys on its servers. All sensitive data remains on your device, and no unencrypted content is transmitted to the server.
* Misuse of SAFE, including attempting to bypass security mechanisms or using the tool for malicious purposes, may result in immediate suspension or termination of your access without prior notice.
* Users are responsible for ensuring that all actions taken with SAFE comply with applicable laws, regulations, and organizational policies.

## 2. Privacy

SAFE is committed to protecting your privacy. The system collects only the minimum metadata necessary to operate and account for usage, including:

* User identification information (User ID or equivalent)
* File sizes and types
* Timestamps of uploads, downloads, and other actions
* Status and accounting information related to system operations

Your actual file contents, passwords, encryption keys, or other sensitive data are **never transmitted to or stored on the server**. SAFE ensures that all sensitive information remains on your local device at all times. Metadata is used solely for operational purposes, monitoring system health, and accounting.

## 3. Security Responsibility

SAFE implements strong encryption, security protocols, and access controls, but the ultimate responsibility for maintaining the security and confidentiality of your files, passwords, and keys lies with you. Users are encouraged to follow best practices for device security, password management, and safe handling of encrypted data.
SAFE cannot be held liable for any data loss, compromise, or security breaches that result from user negligence, weak passwords, or insecure devices.
