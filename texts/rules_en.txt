SAFE Bot – Terms of Use and Privacy Policy
Last Updated: December 5, 2025
Terms of Use
1. Acceptance of Terms
Welcome to SAFE Bot (the “Service”). These Terms of Use (“Terms”) are a legal agreement between you (“User” or “you”) and the provider of SAFE Bot (“we”, “us”, or “our”). By accessing or using SAFE Bot (a third-party service operating on the Telegram platform), you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with any part of the Terms, you must stop using the Service immediately. Using the Service signifies that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms, as well as any other guidelines or policies we provide (including our Privacy Policy outlined below). If you are using SAFE Bot on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms.
Note: SAFE Bot is an independent service on Telegram and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially connected to Telegram Messenger Inc. You must also adhere to Telegram’s own terms of service when using SAFE Bot.
2. Eligibility and User Accounts
•	Real Individuals Only: You must use SAFE Bot only as a real, individual human user. Automated accounts, “bots” accessing the Service, or multiple accounts for one person are not permitted. Each user is allowed only one account (one Telegram user ID) on SAFE Bot.
•	Age Requirements: You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age of digital consent in your country, if higher) to use this Service. If you are under 18, you should use SAFE Bot only with the supervision and consent of a parent or legal guardian. The Service is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly allow such individuals to use SAFE Bot.
•	Telegram Account: SAFE Bot operates through the Telegram messaging platform. You must have a valid Telegram account to use SAFE Bot, and you are responsible for maintaining your Telegram account’s security. Any activity that occurs under your Telegram credentials with our Service is your responsibility.
•	Account Security: You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any authentication tokens or credentials (if any) related to your use of SAFE Bot. Although typically you log in via Telegram, if you are provided with any separate login or API keys by us, do not share them. You agree to notify us immediately if you suspect any unauthorized access to or use of your account.
•	Accurate Information: If you provide any information to us (for example, if contacting support or participating in promotions), you agree to provide true, current, and complete information. Misrepresenting your identity or affiliation is prohibited.
3. Description of the Service
SAFE Bot is a technology service focused on file encryption and decryption, provided through a Telegram bot interface. The Service allows you to protect your files by encryption and later recover them by decryption using a password of your choosing. Key features of SAFE Bot include:
•	File Encryption: You can upload a file through the bot and set a password. SAFE Bot will encrypt the file using industry-standard cryptographic algorithms, producing an output file (typically with a .SAFE extension) that is protected. Only someone with the correct password can decrypt and access the original content.
•	File Decryption: You can decrypt a previously encrypted .SAFE file by providing the correct password. The Service will return the original file if the password is correct.
•	Secure Processing: For user safety, all encryption/decryption operations are handled in a secure manner. We do not store your plaintext files or passwords on our servers after processing (see Privacy Policy for details). We utilize Telegram’s own Content Delivery Network (CDN) and infrastructure to transfer and temporarily hold files, meaning your files stay within Telegram’s secure ecosystem during operations.
•	In-App Currency (Coins): SAFE Bot may use a virtual credit system (“coins”) for executing operations. For example, performing encryption or decryption might require spending a certain number of coins (this could vary by file size or feature). Users can earn coins via promotions or referrals, or purchase coins via supported payment methods (see Section 6).
•	Service Plans: We offer different usage tiers or subscription packages (for example, Bronze, Silver, Gold plans) that provide varying levels of service:
•	Free Tier: Basic encryption/decryption functionality, with certain limits (such as file size caps or slower processing speeds). This tier may be supported by advertisements or sponsor requirements (see Section 7 on Advertisements).
•	Premium Tiers: Paid plans that unlock enhanced features — e.g., ability to encrypt larger files, higher speed or priority processing, removal of ads, access to advanced functions like batch encryption, custom encryption settings (such as multiple encryption keys per file), and secure cloud backup for encrypted files. These plans can be monthly, quarterly, or annual subscriptions as offered. Details of current plans and pricing will be provided in the Service interface and may be updated from time to time.
•	Recent Operations and Logs: The Service interface may allow you to view recent encryption/decryption activities performed under your account (for example, the last 10 jobs, including timestamps, file sizes, operation status, and coins spent). This feature is for your convenience to track usage.
•	Continuous Development: SAFE Bot is subject to ongoing improvements. New features may be added and certain features may change as we update the Service. We will endeavor to inform users of major changes (for instance, via our Telegram channel or updates within the bot). By continuing to use new or updated features, you agree that those features are covered under these Terms.
4. User Responsibilities and Acceptable Use
When using SAFE Bot, you agree to conduct yourself responsibly, ethically, and in compliance with all applicable laws and these Terms. Specifically, you agree to the following conditions:
•	Lawful Purposes Only: You will use SAFE Bot only for lawful purposes. You must not use the Service to engage in any illegal activities or to facilitate the violation of any law or regulation. This includes (but is not limited to) refraining from using the Service to encrypt, store, or disseminate content that is unlawful, harmful, exploitative, or infringes on others’ rights. For example, you must not use SAFE Bot to hide or distribute child exploitation material, terrorist content, copyrighted material that you have no right to distribute, or any other contraband. We reserve the right to report any abuse of the Service to law enforcement if required by law.
•	Content Ownership and Rights: You should only upload files to SAFE Bot that you own or have the legal right to use and encrypt. By using the encryption feature, you confirm that doing so does not violate any intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or other rights of any third party. You are solely responsible for the content of the files you process through SAFE Bot. We do not review the contents of files you encrypt or decrypt, so we rely on you to adhere to this rule.
•	Prohibited Behavior: You must not engage in any behavior that could harm us, the Service, or other users. For example, you agree NOT to:
•	Attempt to gain unauthorized access to SAFE Bot, our systems, or other users’ data.
•	Interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Service, Telegram’s platform, or the data contained therein. This includes not launching any form of attacks, such as malware distribution, viruses, worms, Trojan horses, or any other harmful code through the Service. You also agree not to use automated means (scripts, bots, scrapers) to send requests to or retrieve data from SAFE Bot beyond what is permitted.
•	Misuse the encryption service in a manner intended to deceive or defraud others (for instance, encrypting malicious files to evade detection or using SAFE Bot as part of a fraudulent scheme).
•	Harass, threaten, or impersonate any other person or entity while interacting with SAFE Bot (for example in any support chats or community, if applicable).
•	Remove, alter, or obscure any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices on any content or output from the Service. (For instance, if SAFE Bot outputs any notice with the encrypted file, you should not remove it if asked to keep it intact.)
•	Referral and Rewards Abuse: If you participate in any referral or reward program we offer (see Section 5), you must do so in good faith. You agree not to create fake accounts or multiple Telegram accounts to fraudulently earn referral bonuses or coins. Also, you must not impersonate others or engage in “self-referral” schemes. We have anti-abuse measures in place (for example, limiting the number of referral rewards per user within a certain time frame and requiring referred users to meet activity criteria) and we reserve the right to withhold or revoke rewards and to ban or suspend accounts that engage in abuse or manipulation of referral programs.
•	No Reverse Engineering: You will not attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code or underlying trade secrets of SAFE Bot, except to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this restriction. Similarly, you must not misuse the Service’s protocols or use unofficial methods to interact with SAFE Bot outside the provided Telegram interface or any official API that we may provide.
•	Keep Credentials Safe: If SAFE Bot or any related service provides you with an API key, access token, or password (for example, for accessing a web dashboard or future integrations), you are responsible for keeping such credentials confidential. Do not share them with anyone. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account or with your credentials.
•	Reporting Vulnerabilities: If you discover a security vulnerability or bug in SAFE Bot, we encourage you to notify us responsibly. Do not exploit it. We may provide rewards or recognition for responsible disclosure, but any exploitation of vulnerabilities for personal gain or to harm the Service or users is strictly prohibited and will be subject to legal action.
•	Cooperation: You agree to cooperate with us in investigating any suspected or actual activity that is in breach of these Terms. We reserve the right to monitor usage of SAFE Bot (in compliance with our Privacy Policy) to ensure compliance with these Terms and to investigate any reports of misconduct.
By adhering to these rules, you help us maintain a secure and reliable service for everyone. Failure to follow the above responsibilities and acceptable use standards may result in warnings, suspension, or termination of your access to SAFE Bot, as detailed in Section 9 (Termination).
5. Coins, Referrals, and Rewards
SAFE Bot may implement a system of virtual credits (“Coins”) and promotional rewards to enhance user engagement. This section explains how Coins and referrals work and the terms governing them:
•	Coins (Virtual Currency): Coins are a virtual in-service currency used to access certain features of SAFE Bot (for example, performing encryption or decryption might deduct a number of Coins based on file size or operation type). Coins can be obtained in various ways, such as:
•	Earning Coins: We may grant new users a starting balance of free Coins, and users can earn Coins through referral bonuses or participation in events or promotions we run.
•	Purchasing Coins: Users may have the option to purchase additional Coins using real currency or cryptocurrency (see Section 6 on Payments). If you choose to buy Coins, the pricing and payment process will be disclosed, and upon successful payment, your account will be credited with the appropriate number of Coins.
•	No Cash Value & Non-Transferability: Coins are not real money and have no monetary value outside of SAFE Bot. They are simply a metric to access services within the platform. Coins are non-transferable between users (unless explicitly allowed by a feature we introduce) and cannot be exchanged or redeemed for cash or any monetary equivalent. We reserve the right to modify the coin system, including rates at which operations consume coins or the cost and availability of purchasing coins, at our discretion. We will inform users of significant changes to the coin system (for example, via announcements on our Telegram channel or within the bot).
•	Referral Program: We may offer a referral program where existing users (“Referrers”) can invite new users (“Referrals”) to join SAFE Bot via a unique referral link or code. If a new user joins via your referral and meets the necessary criteria, you may receive a reward (such as bonus Coins or other benefits). Important conditions for referrals include:
•	Unique Users: The referred person must be a genuine new user, with a unique Telegram account that is not already associated with SAFE Bot and is not operated by the Referrer. Using duplicate or fake accounts to game the referral system is strictly prohibited (see Acceptable Use above).
•	Activation Requirements: In order for a referral to be counted as successful (and for a reward to be granted), the referred user may be required to complete certain actions — for example, join a specified sponsor channel on Telegram, verify their account, and successfully complete at least one encryption operation on SAFE Bot. This ensures referred users are active and genuine. We will specify the exact requirements for referrals to qualify (e.g., “the referred user must subscribe to our sponsor channel and execute one encryption job successfully”).
•	Reward Limits: To maintain fairness and prevent abuse (such as fake referrals or “farming” rewards), we may impose limits on referral rewards. For instance, we might cap the number of referral bonuses a single user can earn within a 24-hour period or other timeframe. Additional referrals beyond the cap may not yield further Coins or rewards. These limits are designed to prevent exploitation (such as one person trying to accumulate excessive free Coins through illicit means). We reserve the right to adjust referral reward policies and limits at any time.
•	Fraud and Abuse: If we detect any fraudulent activity or abuse of the referral program — for example, a user creating multiple fake accounts, or a network of users attempting to cheat the system — we reserve the right to invalidate those referrals and withhold or retract any Coins or benefits granted through them. Serious or repeated abuse may result in suspension or termination of the offending accounts.
•	Promotions and Bonus Programs: From time to time, we may run promotional campaigns (such as bonus Coins for completing certain tasks, time-limited events, giveaways, etc.). Any such promotions will be governed by these Terms and any additional rules we publish at the time. Promotions may have their own conditions (e.g., an expiration date for bonus Coins, or a limit of one bonus per user) which will be communicated clearly. We reserve the right to modify or cancel promotions at our discretion, but any earned rewards under a promotion prior to modification/cancellation will be honored in accordance with the published terms of that promotion.
•	No Outside Trading: Users are not allowed to buy, sell, or trade SAFE Bot Coins or rewards outside of the official channels provided by us. For example, you should not attempt to sell your account or coin balance to another person, nor purchase coins from third parties. Any such transactions are against these Terms, and we will not recognize them. We will not be responsible for any losses arising from attempts to exchange coins or accounts outside our Service.
•	Reset and Expiration: Coin balances for active accounts will typically remain available as long as the Service is operational. However, if an account is inactive for an extended period (for example, no logins or usage for a year) or if we suspect the account has been abandoned, we reserve the right to reset or remove coin balances from such accounts (we would generally provide a warning or notice before doing so). Additionally, if the Service plans to shut down or discontinue the coin system, we will notify users in advance so they can utilize any remaining balance.
By using SAFE Bot’s coins and referral features, you acknowledge that these are promotional and in-service features subject to change. We will endeavor to maintain transparency and fairness in how these systems work. If you ever have questions about how Coins or referrals are handled, or believe there has been an error in your coin balance or referral rewards, please contact us (see Contact Information in Section 18) and we will review the issue with you.
6. Payments and Subscriptions
Certain features of SAFE Bot are available only through paid subscriptions or one-time purchases (for example, buying Coins or subscribing to a premium tier). The following terms apply to payments and subscriptions:
•	Pricing and Currency: All prices for subscriptions, packages, or Coin purchases will be communicated in the Service (in the bot interface or official website, if any). Prices may be shown in various currencies for convenience (for example, USD or local currency equivalents). For international users, we may display pricing in local currency or in a cryptocurrency amount if applicable. We reserve the right to adjust pricing for our services or offerings at any time; however, any changes to subscription pricing will not affect you until the end of your current subscription term (unless stated otherwise in a specific promotional offer).
•	Payment Methods: We accept certain payment methods which will be indicated at the time of purchase. These may include payment via cryptocurrency (such as TON – The Open Network), and potentially other methods like credit/debit cards or online payment processors if integrated in the future. If paying with cryptocurrency, you must follow the instructions provided (for example, sending the exact amount of TON to a specified wallet address). For fiat currency payments (if offered), we might use third-party payment processors to handle transactions securely. You agree to provide valid payment information and authorize us (or our payment processor) to charge the applicable amount to your payment method.
•	Transactions in TON or Crypto: If you choose to pay using TON or another supported cryptocurrency, note that such transactions are recorded on their respective blockchain. Cryptocurrency transactions are typically irreversible. Ensure that you send funds to the correct address and in the correct amount. We are not responsible for delays or losses if you make an error in the payment process (e.g., sending to a wrong address or sending the wrong cryptocurrency). We will credit your account for the service or coins purchased once we have verified the transaction on the blockchain (this may require a certain number of confirmations). Cryptocurrency exchange rates can be volatile, but for pricing we will specify the required amount for a given time window or purchase event.
•	Subscription Term and Renewal: If you purchase a time-based subscription (e.g., monthly or annual premium plan), the subscription will begin when we confirm your payment and will continue for the period specified. Renewal policies will depend on how the purchase is made:
•	For cryptocurrency-based subscriptions, we typically do not auto-renew since crypto payments require manual initiation by the user. You will need to manually purchase a new subscription when the current term expires. We may send you a reminder near the end of your subscription term.
•	If in the future we enable an auto-renewal via a payment processor (for example, if credit card subscriptions become available), we will clearly inform you and obtain your consent for auto-renewal. In such a case, your subscription would renew automatically at the end of each term and your chosen payment method would be charged, unless you cancel beforehand. You would be able to turn off auto-renewal at any time to prevent the next charge.
•	Refund Policy: All sales are final. Payments for Coins, subscriptions, or other services are non-refundable, except where required by law or explicitly stated otherwise. Because our service delivers digital goods/features instantly (e.g., crediting coins or enabling premium benefits), we cannot typically offer refunds once a purchase is completed. However, if you believe there has been an error in billing or you did not receive what you paid for, please contact us and we will review the situation. If a refund is issued at our discretion or due to legal obligations, we may deduct fees (for example, transaction fees or currency conversion costs) as appropriate.
•	Chargebacks and Reversals: Initiating a payment chargeback or reversal without first contacting us to resolve the issue is considered a violation of these Terms. If you dispute a legitimate charge, we reserve the right to suspend your account until the dispute is resolved. We also reserve the right to contest any unjustified chargebacks and provide proof of your purchase to payment processors or banks.
•	Taxes and Fees: Our pricing generally does not include any taxes (such as VAT, sales tax) or governmental fees unless otherwise stated. You are responsible for any taxes or duties that may be owed in your jurisdiction as a result of your purchase. If we are legally obligated to collect taxes, we will add those to the charges (and will inform you during checkout). For cryptocurrency purchases, you are responsible for any applicable taxes on cryptocurrency transactions or usage. Additionally, note that cryptocurrency networks might charge transaction fees (gas fees); such fees are typically paid by you directly on the network and are not collected by us.
•	Changes to Offerings: We reserve the right to change what we offer in each subscription tier or package. For instance, we may add new features to a premium tier or adjust usage limits. If we make a material reduction in the core benefits of a paid plan during your subscription period, we will notify you and endeavor to ensure you receive the value of what you paid for (for example, by extending your subscription or offering a different benefit). Price changes or major feature changes for subscriptions will generally apply only upon renewal for existing subscribers, not mid-term, unless a new law or regulation forces a change.
•	Promotional Trials or Credits: We may occasionally offer free trials for premium features or grant promotional credits. Such trials are subject to these Terms as well. If a trial is provided, it will automatically terminate at the end of the trial period unless you actively purchase a subscription. We may require a payment method to start a trial; if so, we will clearly inform you if that method will be charged automatically after the trial unless you cancel. Always review the specific offer details provided.
By making any purchase or payment through SAFE Bot, you represent that you are authorized to use the payment method and that you are either over the age of majority in your jurisdiction or have the permission of a parent/guardian to make the purchase. You also agree that you will not use fraud or stolen payment credentials — such actions may result in immediate termination of your account and potential legal action.
7. Advertising and Sponsorship
The free version of SAFE Bot may be supported by advertising or sponsorships to help fund the Service. We strive to ensure any advertising is not overly intrusive, and we separate user data from advertisers, as explained below:
•	Sponsor Channel Requirement: As a condition of using SAFE Bot’s free services, users may be required to join and remain a member of a specific Telegram channel that features sponsored content (our “sponsor channel” or partner channel). This requirement will typically be presented during the onboarding or usage of the bot (e.g., “Please join our sponsor channel to continue using the free service”). By using the free tier of SAFE Bot, you agree that we can verify your membership in such sponsor channel and that your continued access might be contingent on it. If you leave the sponsor channel, certain features (like earning referral rewards or even using the bot’s free services) may become restricted until you rejoin. We use this mechanism to show you promotions from our sponsors in a way that respects your privacy (sponsor messages are in the channel, not direct messages to you from us, aside from occasional service announcements).
•	In-Bot Notifications: We may occasionally send you service-related notifications or announcements via the bot. These could include tips on using the service, alerts about new features, or promotional offers (for example, informing you of a discount on premium subscriptions or a bonus coin event). We will not spam you; any promotional messages will be limited. Premium subscribers may have the benefit of opting out of promotional messages or might not receive them at all, in line with the “ad-free” experience promised.
•	Advertisements and Content: Any advertisements or promotional content you might see (whether in the sponsor Telegram channel or via messages from SAFE Bot) will typically be provided by us or our partners. We do not hand over your personal data to advertisers without your consent. We simply might show you general ads (for example, a sponsor’s product advertisement in the channel that all users see). We are not responsible for the content of third-party advertisements or promotions. If the sponsor channel posts external links or promotional offers, we do not endorse or guarantee those third-party products/services. Engaging with any third-party content (like clicking a link or making a purchase from a sponsor) is at your own risk, and you should review the sponsor’s own terms and privacy policies.
•	No Third-Party Tracking: We do not serve third-party targeted ads that track you individually. In other words, we are not using ad networks that profile your behavior across different sites/apps. The sponsor messages are generally the same for a broad set of users. We value your privacy and thus avoid invasive advertising techniques. For more details, see our Privacy Policy below.
•	Option to Remove Ads: By upgrading to a premium plan (if you choose to), you will not be required to join sponsor channels or receive promotional content from us. Paid users get an ad-free experience. We will not require premium users to remain in the sponsor channel, and we will cease sending promotional broadcasts to premium users except for essential service communications.
•	User Contributions: If we allow any form of user-generated content within the Service in the future (for example, comments, feedback that is visible to others, etc.), you must not include any advertising or promotional material of your own in such content in a way that violates our Acceptable Use rules or spams other users. Currently, SAFE Bot’s interaction is mostly one-to-one (bot and user), so this is not applicable; it’s mentioned for completeness in case of future features (like community forums or groups).
By using SAFE Bot, you acknowledge that advertising and sponsorships are part of the free service model. We will do our best to keep them reasonable. If you have feedback about the nature of ads or sponsor content, you can reach out to us. We appreciate your understanding that such sponsorships allow us to offer free encryption services to users who might not otherwise afford premium features.
8. Intellectual Property Rights
This section addresses the ownership and permitted use of intellectual property related to SAFE Bot, as well as how we handle your content:
•	Our Proprietary Rights: The SAFE Bot service (including but not limited to all software, code, algorithms, processes, user interfaces, documentation, website content, visuals, design elements, trademarks, logos, and brand names related to SAFE Bot) is owned by us and/or our licensors and is protected by copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws. “SAFE” and the SAFE Bot logo or name are our trademarks or service marks. All rights not expressly granted to you in these Terms are reserved by us. You may not use our name, logos, or any of our branding without our prior written consent, except as necessary for you to identify our Service (for instance, you may state “Encrypted with SAFE Bot” or similar in a non-commercial context).
•	License to Use the Service: Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use SAFE Bot for its intended purpose of encrypting and decrypting your files and related functions. You do not receive any ownership rights in the software or any part of the Service. You agree not to copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Service or included software, nor to reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, except as permitted by law.
•	Your Files and Content: We make no claim of ownership over the files, data, or content that you upload to SAFE Bot for encryption (“Your Content”). You retain all ownership rights to Your Content. These Terms do not grant us any rights to Your Content except for the limited rights necessary for us to operate the Service. For example, you grant us the permission to process your files and data (including making temporary copies and performing encryption/decryption on them) for the purpose of providing the Service to you. This permission includes the right to transmit and store your content as needed (e.g., storing an encrypted version of your file if you use our backup feature, or temporarily caching data on Telegram’s servers), but always solely for your use of SAFE Bot. We do not use or access Your Content for any other purposes, and our Privacy Policy details how we handle data.
•	No Monitoring of Content: We do not routinely monitor or access the content of the files you encrypt/decrypt (and in many cases, such content is encrypted with a password we do not possess). However, if we become aware (for instance, through user report or obvious signs) that content being processed is illegal or violates these Terms, we reserve the right to investigate and take appropriate action, including deletion of the content from our systems or involvement of authorities if required by law.
•	Feedback: If you provide us with any suggestions, ideas, feedback, or reports about problems or improvements related to SAFE Bot (“Feedback”), you hereby grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use and incorporate that Feedback into the Service or our business generally. We appreciate Feedback but are not obligated to compensate you for it. Providing Feedback is entirely voluntary on your part.
•	Third-Party Resources: Some of the software or components used in SAFE Bot may include or make use of open-source libraries or third-party services. Each of those components may have its own license terms. To the extent required by those licenses, we will make such licenses and any required notices available (for example, within our documentation or upon request). You agree to comply with any relevant third-party license terms when they are presented as part of using SAFE Bot.
•	Copyright Infringement Claims: We respect intellectual property rights. If you believe that content on SAFE Bot (for example, something shown in our interface or delivered by us) infringes your copyright, you should notify us with details (a DMCA takedown notice or equivalent, if applicable). We will investigate and respond to any legitimate claims of infringement in accordance with applicable law. Note that this refers to content we provide; as for Your Content (files you upload), since we do not publish those to others, copyright infringement issues should not arise except through your own actions. It is your responsibility not to use SAFE Bot to infringe copyrights of others as noted in “User Responsibilities” above.
9. Privacy and Data Protection
Your privacy is very important to us. Our practices regarding the collection, use, and protection of user data are described in detail in the Privacy Policy (see the Privacy Policy section below). By using SAFE Bot, you agree that we can collect and use your information in accordance with the Privacy Policy. Key points include:
•	We collect only the personal data necessary to provide and improve the Service (such as your Telegram user ID, basic profile info, and the files you submit for processing).
•	We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We use your data primarily to operate SAFE Bot (e.g., performing encryption, tracking your coin balance, etc.), and for security, support, and communication purposes as described in the Privacy Policy.
•	We implement security measures to protect your data and files. Notably, your encryption password is not stored on our systems, and we leverage Telegram’s infrastructure for file transfer/storage to add an extra layer of safety.
•	You have rights regarding your data (for instance, to access or delete personal information) which we honor as detailed in the Privacy Policy.
Please review the Privacy Policy in full to understand how we handle your information. If you do not agree with our data practices, please discontinue use of the Service. If you have questions or concerns about privacy, you can contact us as outlined in the Privacy Policy or the Contact Information section of these Terms.
10. Termination and Suspension
We hope you enjoy using SAFE Bot, but if either you or we need to end the relationship, this section explains how termination works:
•	Your Right to Terminate: You are free to stop using SAFE Bot at any time. You may simply cease using the bot, and you may contact us if you wish to have your account data deleted (see Privacy Policy for data deletion rights). If you wish to discontinue a paid subscription, you can choose not to renew it or, where applicable, cancel future billing. No pro-rated refunds will be given for unused time except at our discretion or where required by law (see Payment terms above). Keep in mind that if you stop using SAFE Bot or delete your account, you will lose access to any remaining Coins or active subscription time unless otherwise agreed by us.
•	Our Right to Suspend or Terminate: We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to SAFE Bot (in whole or in part) under the following circumstances:
•	For Violation of Terms: If you violate any of these Terms of Use or engage in prohibited behavior (Section 4) or other misuse of the Service, we may suspend your account immediately and without prior notice. In cases of minor violations, we may choose to provide a warning and an opportunity to correct the issue at our discretion, but we are not obligated to do so.
•	For Illegal or Harmful Conduct: If your use of SAFE Bot is the subject of an investigation by law enforcement or we believe your actions pose an immediate risk to other users, the Service, or the public (for example, using the Service as part of a criminal enterprise, distributing malware, etc.), we may disable your access and/or report your activity to the authorities as appropriate.
•	Non-Payment: If you have an obligation to pay fees (for example, for a subscription or any paid feature) and you fail to pay them when due, we may downgrade or suspend your access to paid features. We will generally provide notice (such as an in-bot notification or email, if available) of missed payments or expiration of subscription and give you a chance to rectify it before taking action.
•	Discontinuation of Service: In the unlikely event that we decide to discontinue SAFE Bot entirely, or discontinue a major portion of it, we may terminate all user accounts with advance notice. We would provide notice via Telegram (bot message, channel announcement, or other reasonable method) prior to such termination. If you have a paid subscription that extends beyond the termination date, we would refund any remaining unused portion of the fees (if feasible) or otherwise compensate you as required by law.
•	Effect of Termination: Upon termination of your access for any reason:
•	Your right to use SAFE Bot will immediately cease. You must not attempt to circumvent the termination (for example, by using a different Telegram account to access the Service if you were banned for a violation).
•	We may delete or anonymize the data associated with your account in accordance with our data retention policies and Privacy Policy. For example, we may erase your personal information and usage records, though backup copies might persist for a limited time. Encrypted files stored as part of a premium backup feature may be deleted upon account termination or after a grace period, at our discretion.
•	Any Coins or other virtual benefits in your account will be forfeited upon termination. They are not convertible to cash or transferable to another account.
•	If termination was due to your breach of these Terms, we reserve the right to refuse re-registration or reactivation of your account (you may be blacklisted or blocked from interacting with the bot).
•	Survival of Terms: Any terms of these Terms of Use that by their nature should survive termination will survive. This includes, without limitation: Sections concerning Intellectual Property, Disclaimers, Limitation of Liability, Indemnification, Governing Law, Dispute Resolution, and Privacy obligations. In other words, ending your use of SAFE Bot does not free you from obligations under these Terms that are meant to continue or any liability you may have incurred for your actions while using the Service.
•	Appeal or Questions: If you believe your account was suspended or terminated in error, or if you wish to appeal a decision, you may contact us to request a review. We will consider requests in good faith but reserve sole discretion in making final decisions regarding enforcement of these Terms.
Termination or suspension is a last resort to protect our Service and users. We prefer to work with users to resolve issues when possible. However, users are expected to follow the rules, and we will act as needed to maintain a safe and fair environment on SAFE Bot.
11. Disclaimer of Warranties
SAFE Bot is provided to you on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. While we strive to provide a high-quality, reliable, and secure service, we need to make the following disclaimers:
•	No Guarantee of Error-Free Service: We do not warrant that SAFE Bot will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or free of errors, viruses, or other harmful components. Due to the nature of software and internet services, we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays, or imperfections. You acknowledge that use of the Service may occasionally be affected by technical issues beyond our control (such as Telegram platform outages, network downtime, or unforeseen bugs).
•	Encryption and Security: We employ strong encryption algorithms and best practices to secure your files and data. However, we make no guarantee that the encryption cannot be broken or that unauthorized parties will never find ways to defeat our security measures. Importantly, the security of your data also depends on you: you must use a strong, unique password for encryption. If you use a weak password or divulge your password, the encryption can be compromised – and that is outside our control. We do not store your encryption passwords, so we also cannot guarantee data recovery if you lose your password (more on that below).
•	Password Responsibility: You understand that if you lose or forget the password/key you set for an encrypted file, you will likely lose access to that file’s contents permanently. SAFE Bot does not have a “master key” or backdoor to recover your encrypted data (this is by design for your security). We disclaim liability for any data loss resulting from lost passwords. It is your responsibility to remember and securely store any passwords you use with our Service. Consider keeping backups or using a reputable password manager.
•	No Warranty on Fitness for Purpose: We do not warrant that SAFE Bot will meet all of your requirements or expectations. For example, while we aim to support a wide variety of file types and sizes (as per our service description and plan limits), we do not guarantee that every possible file format is supported or that encryption of a particular file will produce the desired outcome in every case. You use SAFE Bot at your own risk, and it is your responsibility to ensure that the Service is suitable for your needs (including any legal requirements for encryption in your jurisdiction).
•	General Disclaimers: To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we (and our affiliates, partners, and suppliers) expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied, or statutory, regarding the Service. This includes any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, and any warranties that may arise from course of dealing or usage of trade. No advice or information (whether oral or written) obtained from us or through SAFE Bot shall create any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms.
•	Data Integrity and Storage: Although we take precautions to protect data, we do not guarantee the integrity or availability of files processed by SAFE Bot. For example, if you utilize our premium feature to store an encrypted file as a backup on our server or on Telegram’s servers, we cannot promise that file will never be lost, corrupted, or deleted due to unforeseen circumstances. We encourage you to keep your own backups of important files (in either encrypted or decrypted form). The Service is not intended to be your sole archival storage.
•	Third-Party Services: SAFE Bot’s performance and availability can be affected by third-party services like Telegram (for delivering messages/files) or blockchain networks (for processing payments). We make no guarantees regarding the continuous availability or error-free operation of those third-party elements. Telegram might impose limits or changes that affect our bot’s functionality (like file size limits or API changes), and we disclaim responsibility for such external constraints. Any content or services provided by third parties (including sponsor advertisements, external links, or payment processors) are subject to their own terms and warranties; we provide no warranty on their behalf.
•	No Professional Advice: Any information or guidance provided by SAFE Bot (such as tool-tips on choosing a strong password, or usage recommendations) is for general help and does not constitute professional advice (legal, security, or otherwise). You should consult appropriate professionals for advice tailored to your situation if needed. We do not warrant the accuracy or completeness of any informational content we provide within the Service, though we strive to keep it up-to-date and correct.
Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of certain warranties. If laws applicable to you prohibit any of the disclaimers in this section, those specific disclaimers may not apply to you, and you may have rights in addition to those outlined here. In such cases, our warranty is limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.
12. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will we (or our directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, or suppliers) be liable to you or any third party for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages whatsoever arising from or related to your use of (or inability to use) SAFE Bot or any of its features. This exclusion applies to any damages for lost profits, lost data, loss of privacy, business interruption, or any other commercial or personal damages or losses, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
Specific scenarios where we will not be liable include (but are not limited to):
•	Data Loss: We are not liable for loss or corruption of your files or data. This covers situations such as an encrypted file being irretrievable, a decrypted file being corrupted, or your data being lost due to a server issue or your failure to back up or remember a password.
•	Security Breach: While we implement security measures, we are not liable for damages resulting from unauthorized access to our Service or to your data, unless it was solely due to our gross negligence. For example, if despite our security some malicious actor gains access to your account (perhaps through your compromised Telegram account or other means), we are not responsible for any consequences of that unauthorized access.
•	Personal Injuries or Property Damage: SAFE Bot deals with digital files; it doesn’t physically interact with users. Nonetheless, we disclaim any liability for any personal injury, or property damage that might somehow be connected to your use of our Service. (This is likely inapplicable, but included for completeness.)
•	Financial Losses: We are not responsible for financial losses related to the use of our Service. For example, if you relied on SAFE Bot for your business and the Service was unavailable at a critical time causing you a financial loss, or if you spent money on our Service and suffered damages (beyond the cost of the Service itself), we do not accept liability for those consequential losses.
•	Third-Party Conduct: We have no liability for the conduct or content of third parties. If another user or a sponsor or any third party causes you harm via our Service (for instance, someone deceives you into revealing a password, or a sponsor link leads to a harmful site), we are not responsible for that. However, we would want to know about any misuse by others, so we can take action if possible (such as banning a malicious user or removing a bad sponsor).
Our total, aggregate liability to you for any and all claims arising out of or related to these Terms or the use of SAFE Bot shall not exceed the amount you have paid to us for the Service in the six (6) months immediately preceding the event that gave rise to the claim. If you have paid us nothing (for example, if you only used the free aspects of the Service), our total liability to you for any claim will be zero dollars (or the minimum amount permitted by law, if a zero liability clause is not allowed). This limitation applies regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise.
Exceptions: Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for certain types of damages (for example, in some places it is not permissible to limit liability for gross negligence, willful misconduct, or for death or personal injury caused by our negligence). In those jurisdictions, our liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law. Nothing in these Terms is intended to exclude or limit any liability that cannot be excluded under law (for example, liability for personal injury caused by our negligence, or for our fraudulent misrepresentation).
By using SAFE Bot, you understand and agree that you are using the Service at your own discretion and risk, and that you will be solely responsible for any damages that may result from your use of the Service, to the extent that applicable law allows.
13. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless us and our affiliates, and our respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, partners, and licensors (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, expenses, and costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs) that arise out of or relate to:
•	Your Use of the Service: Any use or misuse of SAFE Bot under your Telegram account or by someone using your account (with or without your permission), including any content you upload, encrypt, or decrypt through the Service. For example, if you use SAFE Bot to encrypt a file that contains illegal material and that leads to legal action, you will be responsible for all consequences, and you would indemnify us if any claims are brought against us due to that content.
•	Violation of Terms: Your violation of any provision of these Terms of Use or any applicable law or regulation. This includes breaches of the Acceptable Use rules (Section 4). If, for instance, you attempt to hack the Service or spread malware via SAFE Bot and that causes damage or legal issues, you must indemnify us for any costs we incur as a result.
•	Infringement of Rights: Your violation of any rights of a third party through SAFE Bot. If a third party alleges that content you encrypted or actions you took using SAFE Bot infringe their intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or other rights, you will cover all costs of the claim and any damages awarded, as well as our costs of defense, if any.
•	Misrepresentation: Any fraud, misrepresentation, or intentional wrongdoing by you in connection with your use of SAFE Bot. For example, if you falsely claim to be affiliated with us or with Telegram and that results in a claim or damage, you would indemnify us.
We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you. In that case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of such claim. You may not settle any claim that is subject to indemnification under these Terms without our prior written approval, if such settlement would require any action or admission by any of the Indemnified Parties or impose any liability on the Indemnified Parties.
This indemnification provision will survive any termination of your account or the Service. It means you continue to have a responsibility to cover our losses in these situations even after you stop using SAFE Bot.
14. Changes to These Terms
We may update or modify these Terms of Use from time to time as the Service evolves or as legal requirements change. Whenever we make a material change to the Terms, we will take appropriate measures to inform you in advance, such as:
•	Posting the updated Terms on our official website (if applicable) or providing a link to the updated Terms via SAFE Bot or our Telegram channel.
•	Notifying users through SAFE Bot (for example, via a bot message or prompt when you interact with the bot) or via a Telegram broadcast message that the Terms have changed. For significant changes, we will strive to provide notice at least a reasonable time (for example, 15 days) before the new Terms take effect, unless changes are required sooner by law. Minor changes (such as clarifications, typo corrections, or updates that do not reduce your rights) may be posted with less or no prior notice.
By continuing to use SAFE Bot after updated Terms go into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. If you do not agree with a change, you must stop using the Service before the updated Terms become effective and, if applicable, cancel any subscriptions (though no refund will be due for the remaining period except as required by law or our discretion).
We will include a “Last Updated” date at the top of the Terms to indicate when the latest modifications were made. We also may keep an archive or changelog of previous versions available for reference (or provide them upon request) so that you can see how the Terms have evolved.
Remember that these Terms of Use, together with the Privacy Policy, form a contract between you and us regarding your use of SAFE Bot. It’s a good idea to review them periodically. We encourage you to save or print a copy of these Terms for your records. If you have any questions about the Terms, please contact us (see Section 18).
15. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
Governing Law: These Terms of Use, and any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with these Terms or your use of SAFE Bot, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Service provider is established, without regard to its conflict of law principles. (In most cases, this will be the laws of the country or region where our operational headquarters are located. We will specify this jurisdiction if required; if not specified, assume it is the law of our principal place of business.)
If you are a consumer user in a jurisdiction with mandatory consumer protection laws, nothing in this Governing Law section will prevent you from asserting your rights under those laws to the extent those laws apply and cannot be waived by agreement.
Jurisdiction and Venue: You agree that any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or SAFE Bot that cannot be resolved amicably shall be brought exclusively in the competent courts of the aforementioned jurisdiction. You and we both consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts. This means, for example, if our base jurisdiction is set as Country X, then you agree to file any lawsuit in a court in Country X, and to submit to that court’s authority for resolving the dispute.
Alternative Dispute Resolution: Before resorting to formal litigation, we sincerely encourage you to contact us to discuss and try to resolve any issue. Many user concerns can be resolved quickly and to the user’s satisfaction by simply reaching out and communicating. In the event of a dispute, we agree to attempt in good faith to negotiate a resolution for at least 30 days before either party initiates court proceedings. We may also consider alternative dispute resolution methods, such as mediation or arbitration, if both parties agree in writing, but unless such an agreement is made, any formal dispute will be resolved in court as stated above.
Injunctive Relief: Notwithstanding the above, if you violate or threaten to violate our intellectual property rights or other important rights, we reserve the right to seek injunctive or equitable relief in any jurisdiction to protect those rights, without having to post a bond or other security. This is an exception allowing us to act quickly in court if needed to prevent irreparable harm.
International Use: We recognize that SAFE Bot can be accessed from anywhere in the world, and the laws of each user’s jurisdiction may differ. However, by choosing to use SAFE Bot, you agree that the laws and courts specified in this section will govern and adjudicate any disputes (to the maximum extent permitted by local law). If you are in a country that disallows the choices of law or forum in this section, then local mandatory law may apply to that extent, but in all other respects, this section applies.
16. Severability
If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable (if possible), and if it cannot be modified, it will be severed (deleted) from these Terms. In any case, the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect.
In plain terms, this means that if one part of the Terms is found to be unlawful or void, the rest of the agreement isn’t thrown out; it remains valid. The invalid provision will be replaced by a valid provision that comes closest to the intention of the original.
17. No Waiver
Our failure or delay in exercising any right, power, or remedy under these Terms (or our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms) does not constitute a waiver of that right or provision. Similarly, any single or partial exercise of a right or remedy by us does not prevent us from later enforcing or exercising that right or any other right or remedy.
For example, if you violate these Terms and we do not immediately take action, that does not mean we are waiving our rights to enforce the Terms or to act on similar breaches in the future. Every situation is handled on a case-by-case basis, and maintaining leniency in one instance does not set a precedent that binds us in others.
Any waiver of any provision of these Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by an authorized representative of our company.
18. Entire Agreement
These Terms of Use, together with the Privacy Policy (below) and any additional terms or policies that we expressly incorporate by reference or post within the Service, constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding your use of SAFE Bot. They supersede and replace any prior or contemporaneous understandings, agreements, or representations, whether written or oral, regarding the same subject matter.
This means that when it comes to your use of SAFE Bot, you cannot rely on any earlier promises or statements that are not included in these Terms or the documents referenced. If we made any oral or written promises or representations before (for example, during a support chat or in marketing materials) about the Service, and they are not reflected in these Terms or updated policies, these Terms take precedence.
However, this entire agreement clause does not limit our ability to modify these Terms as explained in Section 14 (Changes to Terms). Also, any additional terms for specific features (like a particular promotion’s rules, or additional guidelines for a new feature) are considered part of this agreement once provided to you.
19. Contact Information
If you have any questions, concerns, or feedback about these Terms of Use or about SAFE Bot in general, please feel free to contact us. We value open communication with our users.
Contact Methods:
- Email: You can email us at [support@example.com] with any questions or issues. (Replace “example.com” with our actual support email address as provided in our official channels.) Please include a clear subject line (e.g., “SAFE Bot Terms Inquiry” or “Account Issue”) so we can route your query to the appropriate team.
- Telegram Support: If we have an official support bot or Telegram support channel/community, you may reach out there for assistance. (For example, you might message @SafeBotSupport on Telegram, if available, or join our support group linked in the bot’s menu.) Communication via Telegram will be treated with the same care as email. Just be mindful not to share sensitive personal data publicly in any group; for account-specific issues, a direct message is preferable.
- Mailing Address: If required for any formal correspondence, our mailing address is [insert mailing address, if applicable]. (If we have a business address or registered office, it would be listed here. Users generally won’t need this for routine support, but it may be relevant for legal notices.)
We will do our best to respond to inquiries in a timely manner, typically within a few business days. However, please understand that response times may vary based on the nature of the request and our volume of inquiries.
Language: These Terms are provided in English. If we provide translations in other languages (for convenience or local legal requirements), the English version will govern in case of any conflict or ambiguity between versions (unless otherwise required by law).
Thank you for reading these Terms of Use. Your compliance and understanding help us maintain a great service for everyone. We hope you enjoy using SAFE Bot and find it valuable for securing your files!

Privacy Policy
Last Updated: December 5, 2025
This Privacy Policy explains how SAFE Bot (the “Service”) collects, uses, stores, and protects your personal information when you use our Service. It also describes your rights and choices regarding your information. We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and ensuring compliance with applicable data protection laws. By using SAFE Bot, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Please read this policy carefully to understand our practices. If you do not agree with any part of this Privacy Policy, please do not use SAFE Bot. If you have any questions, you can contact us using the information provided at the end of this policy.
Note: SAFE Bot is a third-party service operating on the Telegram platform. While we handle your data as described here, your use of Telegram itself is subject to Telegram’s own Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. We are not responsible for Telegram’s practices. We encourage you to review Telegram’s privacy policy to understand how Telegram collects and uses your data (for example, your phone number, IP address, and other details that Telegram may have). This Privacy Policy applies only to data that we, as the developers of SAFE Bot, collect and process through the bot and any related services we provide.
1. Information We Collect
We collect only the information that is necessary to provide and improve the SAFE Bot service to you. The types of information we collect fall into a few categories:
A. Telegram Profile Information: When you start using SAFE Bot, Telegram provides us with certain basic account details about you, such as:
- Your Telegram User ID (a numeric identifier unique to you on Telegram).
- Your Telegram username (if you have set one) and/or your display name (the name you’ve chosen to show on Telegram).
- Your language preference (the language code Telegram client uses, which helps us interact with you in an appropriate language if we support multiple languages).
- In some cases, your profile photo or other avatar information is accessible, but we do not store your profile picture; we may only use it transiently if at all (for example, to display it back to you in a user interface if you use a web client). Generally, profile photos are not needed for our service functionality.
- Contact info: Telegram does not automatically share your phone number or email with bots. We do not request your phone number or email through the bot, except if in future we introduce a feature where you can voluntarily link an email for support or account recovery. In such a case, providing that info would be optional and used only for the purpose stated at collection.
B. Messages and Commands: We receive and log the messages and commands you send to SAFE Bot via Telegram. This includes:
- Commands/Inputs: When you interact with the bot’s menu or send a command (for example, pressing a button like “Start new encryption” or sending a text command), we record that action in order to perform the requested operation and maintain a usage log.
- File Uploads: If you upload a file to SAFE Bot for encryption or decryption, we receive that file. Depending on how the process is implemented:
- If you send a file via the Telegram chat to the bot, Telegram’s servers will transmit the file to us (or allow us to download it) for processing.
- If our service uses a Telegram “Web App” interface for file selection and local encryption, the handling might differ (some encryption could occur on your device). However, for most operations, assume that we do temporarily handle the file data to perform encryption or decryption.
- Encryption Metadata: We collect metadata about the encryption/decryption operations, such as the file name (or type), file size, the time of the operation, operation duration, and outcome (success/failure). We also log the number of coins charged for the operation and any other relevant usage details (for example, if an operation was canceled or if it failed due to wrong password).
- Passwords/Keys: We do NOT store the plain-text encryption passwords you provide. When you enter a password to encrypt or decrypt a file, we use it in memory to perform the cryptographic operation. We do not log or save that password to our database. In some cases, we might retain a cryptographic hash of the password or some verification output to verify correctness upon decryption (for example, to quickly determine if a provided password is likely wrong without attempting full decryption), but such data does not reveal the password itself and is discarded after use. Bottom line: the secret key/password remains known only to you (and anyone you share it with), and SAFE Bot does not keep it after the task is done.
- Communications: If you communicate with us through the bot’s support function or by sending messages (e.g., typing a question or using a “contact admin” feature if provided), we will receive those messages. We may keep those communications to address your inquiry and improve our support.
- Sponsor Channel Membership: We may collect information about whether you have joined/are a member of our sponsor Telegram channel (or any required channel for using the free service). Specifically, our bot can check your Telegram account’s membership status in certain channels (Telegram provides an API for bots to verify if a user is in a channel, given the bot is an admin of that channel). We record a flag or status indicating if you have joined the required channel(s). We do not get a list of all channels you’re in — just the ones we ask about. This is used purely to enforce the requirement and not for any other tracking.
C. Device and Technical Information: When you interact with SAFE Bot, especially if using any web-based features (such as a SAFE Bot web interface or mini-app), we may collect some technical data:
- IP Address: For standard Telegram bot interactions, we typically do not see individual user IP addresses, because Telegram relays messages to our server. Telegram’s servers are the ones that connect to our bot’s server. However, if you use a Web App (a Telegram in-app browser window for SAFE Bot) or visit our website (if we provide one for managing your account or viewing terms), your device will connect to our web server directly, and in that scenario, your IP address and possibly browser details become visible to us like any web service. We may log IP addresses of such web visitors for security and troubleshooting.
- Device/Browser Info: Similarly, if interacting through a web interface, we might collect information such as browser type, operating system, device type, and screen size. This helps us ensure compatibility and can aid in diagnosing technical issues. We do not collect device identifiers like IMEI, nor precise location data. We might infer general location from IP (e.g., country or region) to understand our user base distribution or route you to the nearest server, but we do not do geolocation tracking beyond coarse level needed for service efficiency or compliance (e.g., applying correct tax or legal settings).
- Cookies and Local Storage: If SAFE Bot offers a web interface/mini-app, we may use local storage or cookies in your browser for functionality (for example, to save a session token so you remain logged in on the web interface without re-verifying through Telegram frequently). These cookies would be first-party (set by our service) and are not used for third-party advertising. We do not use tracking cookies that follow you outside our own Service context. You can clear or block these at any time, though doing so may affect the web interface functionality (like requiring you to log in again). On purely Telegram bot usage (no external web usage), there are no cookies involved.
D. Usage Statistics: We collect aggregated data about how the Service is used. This includes counts of active users, number of files encrypted per day, average file sizes, performance metrics (like average encryption time), and other statistical data. This information is generally aggregated and anonymized, meaning it is not tied to your personal identity. For example, we may know that “1000 files were encrypted this week” or “User 123 performed 5 operations today”, but when analyzing overall usage we strip personal identifiers. We might still log usage per user internally (to enforce limits or measure individual usage for fair use policy or to display your stats to you), but when we analyze or present data outside the internal context, we do so in aggregate.
E. Financial and Transaction Data: If you make a purchase (such as buying coins or subscribing to a premium plan):
- Payment Processor Data: For cryptocurrency payments like TON, we will record information about the transaction such as the sending wallet address, receiving wallet address (our address), transaction ID (hash), amount, and timestamp. This is necessary to confirm and credit your payment. This information is on the public blockchain as well, but we associate it with your user ID internally to mark your account as paid. We do not collect any personal name or billing address for crypto payments since the blockchain doesn’t provide that.
- Other Payments: If we support other payment methods in the future (credit card, PayPal, etc.), we might use a third-party processor which could provide us limited info like a transaction ID, your country (for tax purposes), and confirmation of payment. We do not receive or store full credit card numbers or bank details; those would be handled by the secure payment gateway. We would only store necessary info like what plan you bought, how much you paid, and when, plus maybe the last four digits of a card and card brand if needed for reference (and only if provided by the processor).
- Referral and Rewards: If you participate in a referral program, we will store your referral code or link, the users who signed up through you (their user IDs), and whether referral rewards were granted. This inherently links your account with others in terms of referral relationships. We use this data to administer the rewards program and detect abuse (as described in Terms). This info is mostly internal, but if you and the person you referred both use the service, each of you might know of the other’s involvement (e.g., the bot might tell you “Your friend [Name] joined via your referral link!” if we have such a feature). We won’t publicly disclose referral relationships beyond that context.
F. Optional Information You Provide:
- Surveys and Feedback: If we ever ask users to participate in surveys, beta testing feedback, or to provide testimonials, any information you provide in those contexts (which might include personal opinions, feature requests, etc.) would be collected. We would use it internally to improve our service or, in the case of testimonials (only with your consent), possibly publish it.
- Support and Contact: When you reach out for support via email or Telegram, you might give us additional info such as screenshots, specific files to troubleshoot (please avoid sending sensitive unencrypted files to us for support; if needed, only send encrypted versions or test data). We will collect whatever information you choose to give us in these communications and use it to assist you.
- Profile Linking: If in the future we provide an option to link your SAFE Bot account with other services (for example, linking with a cloud storage provider or an email address for backup), and you opt to use it, we will collect whatever integration data is necessary (like an OAuth token for the third-party service, or the email address). Such features will be clearly explained when introduced, and you can choose whether to use them.
In summary, the data we collect is mostly of two kinds: (1) Operational data needed to run the encryption service and manage your account (Telegram ID, files for processing, usage logs, coin balances, etc.), and (2) Optional/support data you provide through communications or optional features. We try to limit what we collect to the minimum required.
We do not collect things like: your phone number (unless you explicitly share it), your contacts, your precise location, or your device’s unique identifiers, because those are not needed for SAFE Bot’s functionality.
2. How We Use Your Information
We use the collected information for the following purposes, and we base such processing on appropriate legal grounds (like performing a contract with you, our legitimate interests in running a secure and efficient service, compliance with legal obligations, or your consent when applicable):
•	To Provide and Operate the Service: The primary use of your information is to deliver the functions of SAFE Bot to you. For example, we use your Telegram ID to recognize your commands and associate your data with you; we use the files you send and the password you provide to perform encryption or decryption and return results; we use your coin balance and subscription status to determine what features you can access; and we use the logs of your operations to present you with your “recent operations” history and enforce limits (like daily usage quotas or referral bonuses). Essentially, without processing your data, we cannot fulfill the service you expect (encrypting files and managing your account). This processing is based on contractual necessity – when you use SAFE Bot, you and we have an implicit agreement that we will process your data to provide the service.
•	To Maintain and Improve the Service: We use usage information and feedback to improve SAFE Bot’s performance, features, and user experience. For instance, understanding how many users encounter errors or how long encryption takes helps us optimize our algorithms and infrastructure. Aggregated usage stats might inform us which features are popular or if we need to upgrade our servers. If you provide feedback about a bug or a desired feature, we will use that to fix issues and plan our roadmap. We consider this in our legitimate interest to continuously improve our product. When doing so, we typically analyze data in aggregate form or, if individual data is examined (e.g., investigating a specific user’s error report), we treat it confidentially.
•	To Communicate with You: We use your Telegram account (via the bot) or other contact info you’ve given to send you service-related communications. This includes:
•	Transactional Messages: such as confirmations when you perform an operation (“Your file has been encrypted”), notifications of coin deductions or refills (“You have received 10 bonus Coins!”), alerts when your subscription is about to expire, or security notices (e.g., if we detect unusual activity on your account). These are necessary communications for operating the Service and not promotional in nature.
•	Announcements and Updates: we may inform you of important updates to the Service, such as changes to terms, introduction of new features, downtime maintenance schedules, or security alerts. These could be delivered via in-app messages or via our official channel.
•	Promotional Offers: As part of our service (especially for free-tier users), we might send occasional promotions, such as discount offers for premium plans, referral contests, or updates from sponsors. We handle this carefully: free users might receive these as part of the ad-supported model, while premium users can opt out or not receive them (as per Terms Section 7). We use your data (like knowing you are a free user) to determine if you should get such messages. We consider this use to be within our legitimate interests (to grow our business and inform users) but we also balance it with user experience and legal requirements for marketing communications. Where required by law, we will obtain your consent for certain types of marketing. In any case, you have the ability to opt out of promotional communications (see Your Choices below) – for example, by upgrading to premium to remove ads, or by contacting support to suppress non-essential messages.
•	To Enforce Our Terms and Prevent Abuse: We use data to keep SAFE Bot secure and fair. Examples:
•	We will use your information (like your user ID and usage patterns) to detect and prevent fraudulent or abusive behavior, such as detecting if multiple accounts are colluding for referral abuse or if a single user is making automated requests that could harm service stability.
•	If we have to restrict or ban an account, we use the data we have (usage logs, referral logs, etc.) as evidence for the decision. We may keep a record of banned users and their violations (user ID and reason for ban) to prevent repeat abuse.
•	We might use technical measures such as rate limiting certain actions from your account if we suspect a bot or spam (e.g., too many file uploads in a short time could trigger a temporary slowdown or captcha requirement).
•	Your IP (if visible via web usage) might be used to enforce security (for example, if an IP address is making a huge number of requests indicating a possible attack, we might block that IP).
•	We also enforce age restrictions by generally not targeting or allowing underage users (though we may not have a foolproof way to know someone’s age unless they tell us). If we learn someone is under the allowed age, we’ll use their ID to block them as needed.
This processing is based on legitimate interests in maintaining a safe environment and sometimes on legal obligations (e.g., preventing illegal content distribution).
•	To Comply with Legal Obligations: We may process and use your data when we have a duty to comply with applicable laws or regulations. For instance:
•	If law enforcement presents us with a lawful request (such as a court order) to provide information related to a user, we may need to use and disclose data to the extent required by law. (Our policy on that is covered in the “How We Share Information” section below.)
•	We keep certain transaction records for accounting and tax purposes (for example, payment records, revenue records, possibly including your country if needed for VAT). Financial regulations might require we retain purchase histories for a certain number of years.
•	If there are specific data retention laws (for example, in some jurisdictions, encryption service providers might be asked to retain certain data for a minimum period), we will adhere to those.
•	We may use your country or residence information to apply the correct legal practices (for example, honoring GDPR rights for EU residents, or not allowing the service in countries where encryption services are prohibited by law). We generally infer location by IP during web usage or by the phone code if available (though on Telegram we don’t usually have phone numbers).
•	For Aggregate Analytics and Business Insight: We may use aggregated, anonymized data about our user base and usage patterns to generate business insights and statistics. This helps us understand how the service is doing (e.g., “We have X thousand active users and encrypted Y GB of data this month”). Such analytics do not identify individual users but help in decision making and possibly in demonstrating our service’s performance to partners or investors. For example, we might share public stats like “Our users have securely encrypted over 10,000 files with SAFE Bot!” This is done under legitimate interest and does not compromise individual privacy.
•	To Provide Customer Support: If you reach out with questions or issues, we will use relevant data (like your account info and the details you provided) to assist you. For example, if you say “I didn’t get my coins after paying,” we will check your transaction logs and usage logs to verify and resolve the issue. We may also use support interactions to improve our processes (for instance, if multiple people ask the same question, we might add an FAQ or improve the bot’s guidance).
•	Optional Features: If you utilize any optional integrations or features that require additional data (for instance, if in the future you link SAFE Bot to a cloud storage account to auto-upload encrypted files), we will use the data from that integration solely to provide the intended functionality of that feature. In this example, if you connect a Dropbox account to SAFE Bot, we would use the access token to upload your encrypted files to your Dropbox at your command, and not for anything else. We would store the token securely and you could revoke it anytime. The principle is: data from optional features is used only for that feature and under your control/consent.
We do not use your personal data for any kind of automated decision-making or profiling that produces legal effects or similarly significant effects on you, without human intervention. Any automated systems we have (like anti-spam filters or usage monitors) are only designed to flag issues for review or enforce technical limits, not to make irreversible decisions about individuals without oversight.
Crucially, we will never sell your personal information to third parties, and we do not use your data to show you ads from third-party ad networks. Any promotional communications come directly from us (or our controlled sponsor channel) as described.
3. How We Share or Disclose Information
We understand that your personal information and files are sensitive. We only share information in a few specific scenarios, outlined below. We do not share your data with third parties for their own marketing or advertising purposes.
A. With Your Consent or At Your Direction: We will share your information with third parties if you specifically authorize us to do so. For example:
- If in the future we implement a feature that allows you to explicitly share an encrypted file with a friend via SAFE Bot (maybe by instructing our bot to send a file to another user), then we would be sharing that file with the party you designate, as per your request.
- If you use a feature to publish something (for instance, posting a testimonial or comment in a public group related to SAFE Bot), you are effectively sharing information by your own action.
- If we ever run a promotion or partnership where you are asked, “Do you agree to have your email shared with our partner for a specific benefit?” and you say yes, then we’d share as consented. (This is hypothetical; we currently have no such features requiring that.)
In summary, we will comply with any directed sharing that you actively initiate.
B. Service Providers and Partners: We may employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate or enhance our Service (“Service Providers”). These service providers might perform tasks such as:
- Hosting and Infrastructure: We might host our bot server or databases on third-party cloud services (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, or other hosting providers). These providers effectively have potential access to stored data by virtue of being the platform where data resides. However, they are not allowed to use that data except for providing us the infrastructure service. We take steps like using encryption and access controls to ensure data on these platforms remains secure.
- Data Storage (Telegram): We heavily rely on Telegram’s servers as part of our infrastructure. When you send a file to SAFE Bot, that file is stored on Telegram’s servers (at least temporarily) and delivered to our bot. When we send you back an encrypted file, Telegram again handles that delivery and stores it for a period (so you can download it from the cloud). Thus, Telegram itself is a key “service provider” in the data flow. Telegram’s systems may technically have access to the files and messages (unless you’re in a secret chat, which bots can’t be). However, Telegram is bound by its own privacy policy and security measures (they store chats on their servers with high security, though not end-to-end encrypted for cloud chats). By using SAFE Bot, you understand that Telegram processes your data as an intermediary. We do not control Telegram’s internal processes, but we rely on their platform per their terms. We encourage you to review Telegram’s policies for how they treat user data.
- Payment Processors: If you make a purchase, a third-party payment processor or blockchain network will be involved. For instance, if using TON, the TON blockchain (which is decentralized) will process the transaction. If using a credit card, perhaps a provider like Stripe or PayPal would handle it. These entities will see the necessary financial data to complete the transaction (such as your wallet address or card details). We only share the information needed for payment processing. Payment providers have their own privacy and security obligations.
- Analytics or Diagnostics: We do not currently use external analytics services (and we would avoid using invasive ones), but it’s possible we might use a self-hosted analytics tool or a privacy-focused service to collect aggregated metrics about usage. If we do so, we would ensure no personal identifying information (like names or file content) is sent to those analytics providers. Only general stats (like API performance or error logs) might be collected. We might also use crash reporting services to diagnose app issues if we had a client app; these could collect device info and log data at crash time. At present, however, SAFE Bot runs on Telegram and we don’t have separate mobile apps, so this is minimal.
In all such cases, we contractually (or via terms of service) ensure that service providers only use your data on our behalf and for the purposes of providing their services to us, under obligations of confidentiality and security. They do not have independent rights to your data.
C. Within Our Corporate Group: If SAFE Bot is provided by a company that is part of a group of related companies (subsidiaries, parent company, etc.), we may share information within that group as necessary to operate the service. For example, if our development team is in one entity and the service is technically owned by another, data may pass between them. All such entities will uphold the privacy commitments in this policy.
D. For Legal Compliance and Protection: We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to:
- Comply with a legal obligation: This can include responding to subpoenas, warrants, or other legal processes; responding to lawful requests by public authorities (e.g., for national security or law enforcement in compliance with applicable law). We will only provide data that we are lawfully required to provide. If allowed, we might narrow the request or object if it seems overbroad. Also, if the jurisdiction allows notifying users, we will attempt to notify you of such requests before complying (unless legally prohibited from doing so or if we believe it could endanger others or our operations).
- Protect and defend our rights or property: This includes enforcing our Terms of Use, investigating potential violations, and preventing fraudulent activities. If someone threatens our rights (for instance, a user conducting attacks on our system), we may share data with cybersecurity experts or authorities to mitigate that.
- Prevent or investigate wrongdoing: We may share info in cases of suspected fraud, technical vulnerabilities, or security issues. For example, if a particular account is sending out malware via our Service, we might share relevant data with security researchers or other platforms to help stop the spread.
- Protect the personal safety of users or the public: If we have credible information indicating someone is in imminent danger (for instance, some content processed hints at planned violent wrongdoing), we might share information with law enforcement to prevent harm. (This scenario is very unlikely in our context, but we include it to cover extreme cases.)
- Protect against legal liability: If we face a lawsuit or legal claim, we might need to disclose user data as evidence, as long as it’s relevant and properly required in the legal process.
We will evaluate each legal request carefully and aim to only comply to the extent necessary. Our principle is to preserve user privacy as much as possible while following the law.
E. Business Transfers: If we (or our business assets) are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of assets, or transition of service to another provider, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. For example, if another company acquires SAFE Bot or our company, user information would likely be one of the assets transferred to that new owner so they can continue providing the service to you. In such events, we will ensure that your data remains subject to confidentiality obligations and we will strive to provide notice before any personal data is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. If the new entity plans to handle your data in a materially different way, you would ideally be given a chance to opt out or delete your data beforehand if applicable by law.
F. Aggregated or De-Identified Data: We may share information that has been aggregated or anonymized in such a way that it cannot be used to identify you. For example, we might publish trends about encryption usage, like “Overall, file encryptions have increased 50% this year” or “X% of our users are from Europe,” without revealing any personal data. This type of statistical or analytical data could be shared with partners, in marketing materials, or in community discussions to highlight usage and performance. Importantly, this data will not contain personal details or anything that could be linked back to you individually.
G. Third-Party Content and Links: While not exactly “sharing” your info, it’s relevant to mention that if you access third-party websites or services (like by clicking an external link posted in the sponsor channel or in the bot responses), those third-party sites may collect your data independently. For instance, if you click a link to a sponsor’s site, that sponsor might see that you came from our bot (via a referral parameter perhaps) and then they might track you via cookies on their site. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected by other sites or services. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit. We do not provide them with your info (unless it’s a scenario like consenting to share email as mentioned), but by visiting their site, you are effectively giving them some data (like your HTTP request, etc.). We are not responsible for how they handle that data.
In summary, we treat your personal data with care and do not share it beyond what is necessary for running the service, except in the limited cases described. We especially treat the content of your files and your personal details as confidential. Our employees or contractors are bound by confidentiality obligations; they will only access user data when needed for support or maintenance and even then, they will not unnecessarily view file contents. We also utilize encryption and other safeguards (next section) to reduce what we could even see or share in the first place.
4. Data Storage and Security
We take security seriously and implement a variety of measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no system can be 100% secure, so we want to be transparent about how we handle data.
A. Storage Locations:
- The data collected by SAFE Bot is stored electronically on secure servers. Our servers and databases may be hosted in multiple data centers or cloud regions for reliability and performance. Currently, depending on our infrastructure, your data might be stored on servers located in [for example, the European Union or another region]. (We choose regions considering user base distribution and data protection standards. If our primary servers are e.g. in Europe, then EU data protection laws apply to them even if our company is elsewhere.)
- File data: Encrypted files that you ask us to store (for backup) may reside on our storage servers or possibly in a private cloud bucket. We ensure these are encrypted at rest as well (meaning, even on the storage disk, they might be stored in encrypted form beyond just their .SAFE encryption — effectively double encryption). If stored on a third-party storage service, we use access controls to prevent anyone except our service from retrieving them.
- Telegram’s servers: as noted, when files are in transit, they reside on Telegram’s cloud. Telegram has server infrastructure globally (including in multiple countries). Telegram will route and store your data as per their design. Usually, Telegram stores data in encrypted form on their servers (they encrypt server-disk copies of messages, though Telegram themselves hold the keys for normal chats). The Telegram Data Centre locations are not fully disclosed for all data types, but generally distributed. By using SAFE Bot, you agree that Telegram handles the storage/transmission of your files and messages between your device and our bot server.
- Backups: We maintain backup copies of essential data (like user account info, coin balances, etc.) to prevent data loss. These backups are stored securely (and encrypted) and only accessible by authorized personnel. Backup files might be stored in a different location or cloud service for redundancy. They are protected similarly as primary data. Backup retention is limited (we don’t keep infinite history, only as long as needed for recovery).
B. Encryption:
- In Transit: All communication between SAFE Bot’s server and Telegram’s servers is secured using Telegram’s protocol (which uses encryption in transit between client-server and server-server). Additionally, if any part of our service communicates over standard web protocols (e.g., a web app or our server to a database), we use TLS/SSL encryption so data is encrypted while moving across the internet. For example, our website (if any) will be accessible via HTTPS, and our API endpoints use HTTPS for any direct connections.
- At Rest: We encrypt sensitive data at rest on our servers where feasible. For instance, database entries that contain personal info or tokens might be encrypted or hashed. Passwords for your account (if we ever had a non-Telegram login) would be salted & hashed, but currently we rely on Telegram for authentication. Any secret keys or access tokens we store (like tokens to third-party services if you link them) are stored in encrypted form. The encryption keys for such data are kept secure on our side.
- File Encryption: The core service itself involves encryption of your files. The algorithm and encryption method we use for your file’s content is robust (for example, AES-256 or comparable industry-standard algorithms). When you encrypt a file with SAFE Bot, the output .SAFE file is encrypted with the password you provided, which only you know. We do not store that password, so effectively the file’s confidentiality is protected by that encryption. Even if someone got hold of the encrypted file (say, intercepting it on Telegram or accessing our server storage), they would not be able to decrypt it without the password. This is a key security feature of the service.
- Password Handling: As stated, we never store plaintext passwords for encryption. If we implement any account password (not likely since login is via Telegram), that would also be stored hashed. For encryption jobs, the password is used in-memory and not written to disk. We might use secure memory management to purge it after use.
- Segregation: We isolate each user’s data in our database by user ID. This means your records of operations and coin balance are keyed to your user ID and segregated logically from others. While all data might live in the same database, our application ensures that one user cannot access another user’s records. Additionally, internal roles (like support staff) have role-based access control: not every team member can access user data, and any access is logged.
C. Access Controls:
- Our team members and any contractors can only access personal data on a need-to-know basis. For example, a support agent might look up your account by user ID to help troubleshoot an issue, but they wouldn’t randomly browse user data without cause. We train our staff about privacy best practices and ensure that anyone with access to personal data is bound by confidentiality agreements.
- We use authentication and authorization layers to protect administrative access to databases and servers. Admin consoles (if any) require strong passwords and 2-factor authentication. Server access is limited to key personnel and secured via SSH keys or VPN with audit logs.
- If we detect any suspicious access or anomaly in our systems, we act swiftly to investigate and mitigate it.
D. Monitoring and Testing:
- We monitor our systems for potential vulnerabilities and attacks. This includes keeping software up to date with security patches, using firewalls, and possibly intrusion detection systems.
- We may conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing (either internally or by hiring specialized firms) to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
- If any data breach or security incident were to occur involving your personal data, we would notify affected users and appropriate authorities as required by law. We have an incident response plan to handle such situations, aiming to contain and recover as quickly as possible.
E. Telegram CDN Usage (Specific Measure for File Safety):
One distinctive measure we take for file security is relying on Telegram’s Content Delivery Network (CDN) for file handling. Here’s why and how that matters:
- When you send a file to the bot, the file goes to Telegram’s cloud and then to our bot. If our bot needs to send the file back (encrypted or decrypted), often it will send it as a Telegram file as well. Telegram’s CDN handles the heavy lifting of file data transfer.
- This means that your files are not traveling through a bunch of unknown third-party servers beyond Telegram – they stay within Telegram’s ecosystem and our server. We do not upload your files to any non-Telegram external storage during the normal encryption process (unless you specifically opt for a backup feature, which itself either uses our secure server or again Telegram’s storage via a private channel).
- Telegram’s network is known for its security and has built-in encryption for data in transit. By using Telegram’s CDN, we reduce the number of hops and potential exposure points for your files. Essentially, your file goes from your device to Telegram, then to us, then back to Telegram, then to you. You’re not required to, say, click an external link to download the result from some other host (unless in rare cases for special features, but ordinarily, results come as a direct file message in Telegram).
- Additionally, using Telegram’s infrastructure means we don’t store the file long-term ourselves (unless you request backup). After processing, we typically discard our copy of the original file. The encrypted output is delivered to you via Telegram; Telegram might cache it for some time to allow you to re-download if needed, but that is subject to Telegram’s retention rules (they often keep file data for some days/weeks for availability, but that’s on their end). We don’t keep your original file content on our server after encryption is done, except transiently in memory or temporary storage that is promptly erased.
- By not transferring your files through additional third-party services, we mitigate risk and rely on Telegram’s proven infrastructure. It’s important to note, Telegram’s standard cloud chats are not end-to-end encrypted, but they are encrypted on Telegram’s servers and protected by Telegram’s security measures. Also, since you are encrypting the files through SAFE Bot, the most sensitive content (the file’s actual content) becomes encrypted by our Service (with your password) before it’s stored or forwarded further. That adds an extra layer so that even Telegram’s storage has ciphered content (for encrypted files).
F. Data Retention in Security Context: We keep logs of system access and operations (like who logged into our server, what actions were taken on the database, etc.) for security auditing. These logs are kept secure and only used to monitor and audit our team’s or system’s actions. They help in forensic analysis if something goes wrong.
G. Limitations: While we implement all these measures, it’s important for users to also practice good security hygiene: keep your Telegram account secure (use two-step verification on Telegram, don’t share your Telegram login code or bot tokens), protect your devices with passwords, and choose strong encryption passwords for your files. If your Telegram account or device is compromised, someone could potentially misuse SAFE Bot as you or access files that are delivered to your Telegram app. We cannot guard against threats on your end such as someone looking at your phone or intercepting your Telegram SMS code. Please stay vigilant about your own account security.
In case of any questions about security, or if you suspect a vulnerability or security incident, contact us immediately. We appreciate help from the community in identifying any security issues (responsible disclosure).
5. Data Retention
We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, as described in this Privacy Policy, or as required by law. How long we keep data can vary depending on the type of data and the context of our interactions with you:
•	User Account Data: Basic account information like your Telegram User ID, username, and coin balance, subscription status, etc., is kept as long as you are a user of the service. If you stop using SAFE Bot, we may retain this information for a certain period in case you return or to keep records of transactions. In general, if an account is completely inactive for an extended period (e.g., 1-2 years) and has no active subscription, we may deem it abandoned and purge personal data associated with it, to reduce storage and for privacy. However, we will typically retain minimal information (like the user ID and the fact an account existed) to avoid reassigning coins or referrals erroneously if the user comes back, unless you request full deletion.
•	Encrypted Files (Backup Storage): If you are a premium user who uses our secure backup storage for your encrypted files, we will retain those encrypted files on our servers until you choose to delete them or until a reasonable period after your subscription lapses. Specifically, if your premium subscription ends and you do not renew, we might retain your previously stored encrypted files for a grace period (say, 30 days) in case you re-subscribe or need to retrieve them, and after that period we may delete them from our servers. We will try to notify you before deleting stored files due to subscription lapse. Of course, you can also delete any stored file yourself through the Service interface (once implemented) or by contacting support, and we will then remove it promptly from active storage (and ensure it’s scrubbed from backups within a reasonable time frame).
•	Operation Logs: We keep logs of your encryption/decryption operations (metadata like timestamps, file sizes, etc.) to provide you the service features (recent history, and for support/debugging). These logs generally persist as long as your account exists, but we might limit how far back you (and even we) can see detailed logs to ensure privacy. For example, the bot might only show you the last 10 events; internally we might keep more for analytics, but possibly anonymize older entries. If you request deletion of your data, operation logs would be part of what we scrub (except any that we must keep legally).
•	Referral Info: Referral associations (who referred who and when) are kept to properly credit referrers and monitor abuse. If you delete your account or it’s inactive, we might still retain the fact that a certain user ID referred other user IDs, to maintain consistency in our metrics and prevent someone from re-joining and referring the same people etc. However, such data without active accounts attached becomes mostly anonymized (just IDs). If all involved accounts are deleted, referral links become moot and we can purge them as well.
•	Payment and Transaction Records: We retain payment transaction records as long as required for accounting and legal compliance. For example, financial records may be kept for a number of years (often 5-7 years, depending on jurisdiction) for tax audit purposes. This could include data like transaction dates, amounts, and what was purchased (subscription type or coin amount). If these records contain personal data (e.g., if we had a billing name or email), those too would be retained in the financial record until the retention period passes. However, we minimize what personal data is in these records (crypto transactions usually have none beyond an address).
•	Communications: Support emails or messages may be retained for a period so we have context for any future conversations and to improve our services. Typically, we might keep support logs for a year or two unless you request otherwise. If it’s a public Q&A (like a question in a community group), that’s as per Telegram’s retention (which is essentially indefinite unless deleted). Private communications we can delete on request.
•	Analytics Data: Aggregated analytics and logs might be retained longer since they are not tied to personal identifiers. For instance, we might keep general usage numbers and server performance logs for historical analysis. These won’t identify you personally.
•	Legal Retention: If we are under legal obligation to retain data (for example, a law enforcement preservation request, or data needed for resolving a dispute), we will hold that data isolated for as long as required (and only use it for that obligation). Once no longer needed, we will dispose of it securely.
•	Deletion Procedure: When data is deleted from our systems, we take care to remove it from active databases. There might be a short delay as data propagates to backup systems; our practice is to also remove or overwrite personal data from backups when feasible during routine backup rotation. For example, our backups might be encrypted and we might let old backups expire, or we might implement processes to specifically delete user-specific data from backups if a deletion request is made. Due to backup cycles, complete purge from all storage (especially from offsite backups) might take a certain amount of time (commonly up to 30-60 days). We will not use your data in the interim after you requested deletion except to actually delete it.
If you wish to delete your account or data, see Section 7 (Your Rights) below for how to initiate that. We will ensure that personal data is erased in line with what the law requires and in accordance with our procedures described here.
Keep in mind that after deletion or account closure, some data may remain in our archives or logs but in a form that cannot readily identify you. For example, we might keep an identifier code and note that “User X account deleted on [date] per request” just to maintain an audit trail that the deletion was done (without keeping the personal data itself). Also, any messages you sent in public channels/groups (if any) or data other users have (like if you referred a friend, the friend’s account might still reflect that they were referred by a now-deleted user ID, albeit maybe marked as deleted) are not fully within our control to erase from those other places – but nothing of that sort should reveal your identity beyond maybe an ID or username.
6. Children’s Privacy
SAFE Bot is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (and in certain jurisdictions, under 16 – we align with whichever age is applicable for data consent in your region, known as the age of digital consent). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under this age threshold. If you are under the minimum required age, please do not use SAFE Bot or provide any personal information to us.
We do not design any part of our Service to attract minors, and the content of the service (file encryption, cryptocurrency payments, etc.) is generally geared towards adult users or at least teenagers above the consent age.
If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal data from a child under 13 (or applicable age) without parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information as soon as possible. For example, if a parent or guardian contacts us and says, “My 12-year-old was using your bot without permission; please remove their data,” we will verify the claim and if confirmed, delete the account and any associated personal data from our records.
Parents or guardians who believe that we might have any information from or about a child under the consent age should contact us immediately (see Contact Information section). We will promptly investigate and remove any such data in compliance with applicable laws (such as COPPA in the U.S., or similar child data protection regulations elsewhere).
Note: Telegram itself has an age restriction (generally 16 in the EU, 13 in the US, according to their terms). Since our Service operates via Telegram, it’s expected that users under those ages shouldn’t be on Telegram in the first place. We rely on Telegram’s measures and user honesty regarding age. We do not have a mechanism to independently verify age, but we reserve the right to ask for age verification if we suspect a user is underage (for instance, if we get reports or see evidence). If such verification is not provided, we will terminate the account.
7. Your Rights and Choices
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data. We are committed to honoring those rights and providing you control over your information. Below, we outline general rights that apply (especially under regulations like the EU’s GDPR, UK GDPR, and similar laws) and how you can exercise them. Even if you are not in a region with specific legal rights, we will try to reasonably accommodate your requests about your data.
A. Access: You have the right to request access to the personal data we hold about you. This is sometimes called a “Data Subject Access Request.” It means you can ask us for a copy of the information we have collected about you. We can provide you with details such as:
- What data we have (categories, and typically a copy of actual data like account info, logs, etc., to the extent it’s considered personal data and not trade secret or affecting others’ rights).
- The purposes for which we process it.
- The recipients or categories of recipients with whom it has been shared.
- How long we plan to store it (or the criteria we use to determine retention).
We will provide this information in a commonly used electronic format. Typically, we aim to fulfill access requests within 30 days as required by many laws. (It could be extended by another 60 days for complex requests, but we’ll inform you if so.)
B. Rectification: If you believe any personal data we have about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you have the right to request correction or completion of that data. For example, if your username changed or we recorded something incorrectly in your profile, let us know and we will update it. In many cases, since we rely on Telegram for profile info, updating your Telegram name or username will automatically reflect on our side. But internal data like coin balances, etc., if you find a mistake, we will investigate and fix any errors.
C. Erasure (Right to be Forgotten): You have the right to request deletion of your personal data. You can ask us to erase your information from our systems. This is not an absolute right—there are exceptions (like if we are required to keep the data by law, or if retaining it is necessary for legal claims, fraud prevention, etc.). But we will honor deletion requests for data we are not obliged to keep.
- If you want to delete your entire SAFE Bot account and all associated personal data, you can send us a request (for example, via email or through the bot if such an option is available). We may ask you to verify your identity (likely by sending a confirmation through your Telegram account) to prevent fraudulent deletion.
- Once verified, we will remove personal data such as your user profile, operation logs tied to you, coin balances, etc., from active databases. As noted in Data Retention, it may take a bit to fully purge from backups. We will confirm with you once the main deletion is done.
- Some data we might not delete immediately if it falls under exceptions: e.g., we might keep transaction records if you made purchases, but we would detach your identity from them if possible (e.g., keep the record “Purchase made on X date for Y amount” but not tied to your name). Also, if your referral actions gave coins to others, we may keep a note that those coins were earned legitimately, but without retaining your identity. The aim is to scrub personal identifiers while preserving system integrity.
- After erasure, if you try to use the bot again, it would treat you as a new user (since we wouldn’t have your old data).
D. Restriction of Processing: You can request that we restrict (pause) the processing of your data in certain circumstances. For instance, if you contest the accuracy of data we hold, you can ask us to stop processing it (aside from storing it) until we verify its accuracy. Or if you object to processing and we are evaluating your objection. While processing is restricted, we can still store your data but will not use it for anything else. Given our service’s nature, restriction might simply mean you stop using the service while we hold the data, or we disable certain features. We will let you know if granting restriction (like not processing your data) means we have to deactivate your access for that period (since we can’t provide the service without processing).
E. Data Portability: You have the right to data portability, which means you can request to receive your personal data that you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, and you have the right to transmit that data to another controller (service), where technically feasible. In practice, this might mean we give you a JSON or CSV export of your account info and operation history. This right applies to data processed by automated means that you provided or that was generated through your use (for example, your usage logs, account details). If you request, we can send the file to you, or if possible, directly to another service at your direction (though currently there’s no analogous service we’d transfer to, but the option is yours).
F. Objection: You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data in certain circumstances, especially if we process it on legitimate interest grounds or for direct marketing. For example:
- If we ever send you direct marketing (promotions) you can opt out or object at any time, and we will stop sending those. We already ensure opt-out for promotional messages is available (e.g., upgrade to premium or contact us to opt-out).
- If you object to processing that we do for our legitimate interests (like analytics or anti-fraud), you need to provide a reason based on your particular situation. We will then evaluate whether our legitimate grounds override your privacy concerns. If your rights outweigh our reasons, we will cease or adjust the processing. If, for instance, you object to being included in certain aggregate analytics, we might exclude your data from those calculations. Usually, since our analytics are anonymized, it’s not impacting you personally. But anyway, we respect objections and will consider them seriously.
- Note: If you object to processing that is integral to providing the Service (like storing your files or processing commands), then the result might be that we can no longer provide the Service to you. We’ll inform you if that’s the case, so you can decide whether to continue or not.
G. Withdraw Consent: In cases where we rely on your consent to process data (which generally would be rare, as most of our processing is contractually necessary or legitimate interest), you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. For example, if you gave consent to receive newsletters, you can unsubscribe; if you gave consent to some optional data collection like a survey, you can withdraw it. Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing done prior to withdrawal.
H. Automated Decision-Making: We currently do not make any decisions about you that have a legal or similarly significant effect solely by automated means. If we ever implement such processes, you would have the right to request human intervention, to express your point of view, and to contest the decision.
To exercise any of these rights, you can contact us (see Contact Information at the end of this Privacy Policy). We may need to verify your identity (for instance, we might request you send a message from your Telegram account to our bot or provide certain info that matches what we have) to ensure that these rights are being exercised by the correct individual. This is to protect your data from unauthorized access or changes by someone else.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights. Our service is the same whether or not you exercise rights (except obviously, if you delete data or object to processing necessary for service, we might not be able to continue service).
I. California Privacy Rights (if applicable): For users in California (USA), state law (CCPA/CPRA) might give you rights similar to the above, like access, deletion, knowing what categories of data are collected and shared, opting out of “sale” of personal info, etc. We do not sell personal data as defined by CCPA. We’ve basically covered access and deletion which apply similarly. If you’re a California resident and have specific inquiries about how CCPA applies, let us know; we aim to comply accordingly.
J. EU/EEA and UK Users: Under GDPR, aside from the rights mentioned (access, rectification, erasure, restrict, object, portability, withdraw consent), you also have the right to lodge a complaint with a Data Protection Authority (DPA) in your country if you believe we have infringed your privacy rights. We ask that you try to resolve any issue with us first, but you have the right to go to the supervisory authority directly. For reference, if our lead authority is say in an EU country where we are based, we will provide that contact.
K. Managing via Telegram: Some basic aspects of your data you control via your Telegram account settings itself. For example, your Telegram profile name, picture, etc., you can change anytime. If you change your username or picture, our bot sees the updated info next time you interact. If you delete your Telegram account entirely, our bot won’t be able to interact with you, and we’d likely treat it as a deletion request (though to be safe, you might want to tell us to erase your data too, as we might not automatically purge for an account deletion on Telegram unless we know for sure). Also, leaving the sponsor channel is under your control (though it may limit service features, but it’s your choice). So you have choices both within our service and by controlling your Telegram presence.
We are dedicated to ensuring you can exercise your privacy rights. We’ve built the service with privacy in mind, so hopefully such requests are straightforward. Please note that some requests (like deletion) are irreversible – if we delete your data and later you come back, we won’t have your old settings or balances unless you kept proof. So do consider that when making requests.
8. International Data Transfers
SAFE Bot is accessible to users around the world. The data we collect may be transferred to, stored, and processed in countries other than your own. Our servers might be located in one or more countries (for example, in the European Union, the United States, or other jurisdictions). While the data protection laws of those countries may differ from those in your jurisdiction, we take steps to ensure that your personal data is protected in line with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.
If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, or other regions with data transfer restrictions: whenever we transfer your personal data outside of your area (to a country that hasn’t been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection by your local authorities, such as the European Commission for EEA data), we will implement appropriate safeguards.
These safeguards may include:
- Standard Contractual Clauses: We may rely on standard data protection clauses (also known as Model Clauses) approved by regulators to ensure that receiving entities (like our service providers or affiliated companies in non-EEA countries) commit to protecting your data according to a high standard.
- International Frameworks: If applicable, we might rely on frameworks like the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (formerly Privacy Shield) or any UK extension of it, if the entity is certified under that, for transfers to the United States. (However, currently we prefer SCCs and other mechanisms as Privacy Shield was invalidated, but new frameworks may come into play.)
- Your Consent: In specific cases, we might ask for your explicit consent to transfer data to a particular third country if that is necessary and other safeguards are not in place. You’ll be informed of any potential risks and you can choose whether to consent.
- Necessary for Contract: In some instances, transferring data is necessary to perform the service you request (for example, if you’re encrypting a file and our server is in another country, that’s inherently a transfer needed to fulfill your request). International communication via internet inherently involves data transfers. By using the service, you acknowledge that this transfer occurs for service delivery.
We want to highlight that Telegram itself (as part of its operation) might route your data globally. Telegram’s data centers are distributed (they claim to have servers in various regions). Telegram states that they store different categories of data in different jurisdictions for security (e.g., keys separate from data). When using our bot, your messages and files go through Telegram’s cloud which may involve international transfers outside your country or the EEA. This is governed by Telegram’s terms. By using SAFE Bot (a Telegram-based service), you understand that your data will be handled by Telegram across borders as well. Telegram, to our knowledge, employs strong encryption in transit and storage and is GDPR compliant (they have statements about handling EU data within the EU, etc., but also offloading parts elsewhere). We align with Telegram’s approach and add our safeguards on top (like encrypting file content as discussed).
If you have questions about international data transfers or need more specifics (like a copy of the relevant contractual safeguards), you can contact us.
Despite where your data is processed, we will apply the protections described in this Privacy Policy. We also monitor changes in privacy regulations to ensure ongoing compliance with cross-border data protection requirements.
9. Third-Party Links and Services
SAFE Bot’s primary interface is via Telegram, and we might also have a website or documentation pages. These interfaces may contain links to third-party websites, services, or content that are not operated by us. For instance:
- Sponsor or partner links (e.g., a link to a sponsor’s website or product that we share in the sponsor channel or in a message).
- Payment provider pages (if you click a payment link or QR code, you might be taken to a crypto wallet app or a payment page on another site).
- External knowledge base or blog links (if we provide resources like “Learn more about encryption here,” it might go to an external site).
- Possibly our social media pages or community forums which are on different platforms.
This Privacy Policy does not cover how those third-party services or sites process your data. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any third parties, even if you access them through our Service. For example, if you visit a sponsor’s site, they might collect cookies or ask for personal info; that would be governed by their privacy policy, not ours.
We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party sites or services you visit or use.
Specifically regarding Telegram: Using SAFE Bot means you are using Telegram. Telegram is a third-party platform with its own privacy policy (which you agreed to when signing up for Telegram). Key points about Telegram:
- Telegram will have your phone number, contacts (if you allowed address book access), message metadata, etc. We as the bot developer do not see your phone number or contacts, but Telegram has them.
- Telegram may log your IP addresses and device info each time you connect. They have their policy about how long they keep IP logs (in 2021, they said IP logs are kept for 12 months for security).
- Any general issues of Telegram privacy (like Telegram sharing info with authorities under specific conditions for anti-terrorism, as they mention in their policy) are outside the scope of SAFE Bot’s policy.
- If you have concerns about Telegram’s data handling, you should refer to Telegram’s privacy resources. We operate under the assumption that Telegram provides a secure environment and we add to it. But we can’t control Telegram’s own data processing (for instance, if Telegram were compelled to disclose certain data, that’s not under our control).
Third-Party integrations (if any): Currently, SAFE Bot doesn’t integrate with external services beyond necessary ones (Telegram, TON blockchain, etc.). If in the future we enable something like saving files to Google Drive, or authenticating via another platform, then that will involve interacting with that third party’s API and their terms would apply to whatever data you choose to send to them. We will obtain your permission before enabling such integration, and you can revoke it anytime.
Community forums or social media: If we host a user community on Telegram groups or channels, note that anything you post there is visible to others – it’s not private data at that point. The information you share in a public forum or a social media page (like asking a question on Twitter) is by nature public. That data can be seen and used by third parties (like search engines indexing it, or others taking your advice). Just be mindful of your own privacy when engaging outside the secure channels.
In short, when you leave the SAFE Bot environment (the bot or our official site/app) for another site or service, your data handling is under that entity’s control. We try to only point you to trustworthy third parties and partners, but we cannot guarantee their practices.
10. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technologies, legal requirements, or for other operational reasons. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any changes on this page and update the “Last Updated” date at the top.
If the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice of the update. For example, we might announce the changes through SAFE Bot (via a message or notification) or via our Telegram channel, or even send a direct communication if appropriate. Significant changes could include things like: expanding the types of personal data we collect, changing how or why we use data in a way that you wouldn’t expect, or changes in who we share data with (like adding a new major partner).
We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information. Your continued use of SAFE Bot after any changes to this Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy. If you do not agree with the changes, you should stop using the service and you may exercise your rights (such as requesting deletion of your data).
For material changes, especially those requiring consent by law, we will seek consent if and where necessary. For example, if we ever decided to use data for a new purpose that originally required consent, we would get your consent first.
We will also keep older versions of this Privacy Policy (or a summary of changes) available. If you wish to see a prior version, you can contact us. Sometimes we might provide a summary of changes in an update notice so you can quickly see what’s different.
11. Contact Us
If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please do not hesitate to contact us. We are here to help and address any privacy or security issues you might have with SAFE Bot.
You can reach us through the following means:
- Email: Send an email to [support@example.com] (replace with our actual contact email). This is our dedicated support and privacy contact address. Please mention that your inquiry is about privacy or data, so we can route it appropriately. If you are exercising any of your rights (like access or deletion), it may help to mention your Telegram username or ID so we can locate your data (do not include sensitive info like password, though). We may follow up to verify your identity through your Telegram account.
- Telegram: You may contact our support via the SAFE Bot or a support bot/account we provide. For instance, sending a message like “/support” within SAFE Bot might connect you to a human or give you instructions. Alternatively, we might have a support Telegram handle such as @SafeBotSupport. If such direct support via Telegram is available, you can drop us a message there. However, note that detailed personal data requests might still be directed to email for proper identity verification and tracking.
- Postal Mail: (If applicable) If you need to send us formal correspondence or legal notices, you can do so at our registered business address: [Insert Company Name/Operator Name], [Street Address], [City, Postal Code], [Country]. This is typically for official use; for normal user inquiries, email or Telegram is much faster.
- Data Protection Officer (DPO): If we have appointed a DPO (as required under GDPR for some companies), you can contact them at [DPO contact, if any]. (We will specify if we have one or otherwise a privacy point of contact.)
We will respond to your inquiries as soon as reasonably possible, and at most within the timeframes required by law (for example, within 30 days for a GDPR data rights request, unless an extension is needed). Our goal is to be responsive and helpful.
If you’re not satisfied with our response, and you are in the EU/EEA or certain other jurisdictions, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local Data Protection Authority. We would, however, appreciate the chance to address your concerns first. We take privacy seriously and will work with you to resolve any issue.
Thank you for trusting SAFE Bot with your secure file encryption needs. We are committed to protecting your privacy and data security. This Privacy Policy is meant to provide transparency and assurance of that commitment. If anything is unclear, let us know — we believe in clear communication when it comes to your personal information.
